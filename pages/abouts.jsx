                I attend the university of computer studies in Mandalay.
                Currently, I am postponing my journey and start learning by
                myself cause of the covid and the various things happening in
                Myanmar.

                  I specialized in and love React and Next.js for Server-Side
                  Rendering. As for styling, although I prefer Tailwind for
                  styling and stuff, I use bootstrap as my second choice.
                  Unfortunately, as for animation, I can only work with framer
                  motion. As in mobile development, I first learned about
                  Flutter. After working with flutter for about six months, I
                  tried React-Native. Both are amazing tools to create
                  cross-platform apps. Because of both React-Native and
                  Flutter&apos;s flexibility, both are frameworks that I am
                  happy to work with.

                I love creating clean and beautiful UI applications and
                websites. I am willing to discuss newer technology with
                different people. Leetcode questions are my kryptonite and I use
                Vim in vs code. I love working with other developers and UI
                designers, so feel free to connect with me to build amazing
                stuff.
